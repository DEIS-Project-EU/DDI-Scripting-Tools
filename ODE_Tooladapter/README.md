# ODE Tooladapter

The ODE Tooladapter can be used to export a toolspecific model to a ddi, import a ddi into a modeling tool and execute [Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/) scripts on already existing DDI-files.

For language independent communication between the tooladapter and modeling tools, [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org) has been choosen as framework to define the services. 

# Prerequisites

1. The ODE Tooladapter project depends on the [ODE Metamodel](https://github.com/DEIS-Project-EU/DDI-Scripting-Tools/tree/master/ODE_Metamodel/ode.concept.deis) project.
2. Before running the ODE Tooladapter inside Eclipse, all ecore files of the metamodel have to be registered.

# Metamodel change adaption

After the ODE metamodel has been changed, the Thrift contract and the ODE Tooladapter have to be adapted. The adaption steps are listed below: 

1. Adapt changes in the Thrift contract. Under *\ThriftContract\ODEv2ThriftContract\Structs* you can find a .thrift file for each metamodel package. In these .thrift files the ODE metamodel types are defined in [Thrift interface description language](https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl) (IDL).
2. Generate language specific code from Thrift.
   - On Windows you can use [this](https://github.com/DEIS-Project-EU/DDI-Scripting-Tools/blob/master/ODE_Tooladapter/ThriftContract/ODEv2ThriftContract/GenerateCode.bat) batch file to generate code for C#, C++ and Java. Code generation for other languages can be added. 
   - For other OS thrift files have first been merged before generating code.
3. Import generated code into your tool and into tooladapter (ode.tooladapter.gen_ThriftContract.thriftContract).
4. Update Thrift2Emf-transformations and EMF2Thrift-transformation in *ode.tooladapter.src.transformation* according to your metamodel changes.
